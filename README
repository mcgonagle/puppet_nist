README
------
The purpose of these Puppet manifests and kickstart file is to assist system 
administrators deploying the United States Government Configuration Baseline
(USGCB) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. These were created by NSA SNAC to
support adoption of USGCB settings.

Puppet is only one method that is available for automating the configuration and
management of systems, and the existence of this resource does not constitute an
endorsement of it.  Information on Puppet is available at www.puppetlabs.com.
Even if Puppet is not the management software used in your environment, these
files should demonstrate how to apply security-relevant settings from the
baseline.  These files should also demonstrate and reinforce the idea that
whenever many systems should be operating with similar settings, their
configuration and management should be automated by software designed for that
purpose.

Always test in a controlled lab environment before deploying any software on
production systems.

See the file INSTRUCTIONS for information on how to perform an installation of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and configure it to be compliant with the baseline.
